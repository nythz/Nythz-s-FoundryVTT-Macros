# Nythz's FoundryVTT Macros
Repository for Nythz's Foundry VTT Macros

Thanks to all the original modules and system devs for their good work that lets me do these.

To do :
- Make a menu for the macros and other useful commands
- Make macros to use the macros from compendium so it gets the new version on updates (like pf2e-workbench)
- Make a compendium/module
